/**
 * Dynamic colour is deliberately not used.
 *
 * This app spends its whole life distinguishing *this device* from *another
 * device*, and it does that with a cool colour against a warm one. Handing the
 * palette to the wallpaper would mean that opposition survives on some phones
 * and collapses into two shades of the same hue on others - and it would do so
 * silently, on someone else's device, where it cannot be seen to have happened.
